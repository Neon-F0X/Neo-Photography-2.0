				<h1>Portraits:</h1>						
				<img src="images/self-portrait2.JPG" alt="Neon Romance" class="round" width="500">
				<p>Though this portrait looks out of focus, I didn't realize that the exposure does add some touch to the picture. This was part of a project done from a photography course I took a couple years back.</p>
				<img src="images/double-exposure.jpg" alt="Double exposure" class="round" width="500">
				<p>So far, I only have self-portraits from my photography class I've taken back then. In the future I do plan on adding more synthwave themed portraits to diversify my collection of portraits in the future.</p>

				<h1>Architecture and Street Photography:</h1>
				<img src="images/pop-culture-museum.png" alt="Minimalist Architectual Photo" class="round" width="500">
				<p>Just a rather minimal horizontal picture of the details of the Pop Culture Museum at the Seattle Pacific Science Center taken during a gloomy day in Seattle, Washington</p>
				<img src="images/brutal-architecture2.png" alt="Brutalism Part 2" class="round" width="500">
				<p>Not nesseccarily the best looking view, but as you can see, I am also a huge sucker for urban photography as well as for taking pictures of architecture that seem to have futuristic properties implmented to them. I am a massive fan of oppressive looking buildings that echo the corporate abyss most science-fiction media base their themes around, and the desperation of the atmoshpere these pictures contain. </p>
				<img src="images/pike-place-night.png" alt="Pike place at night" class="round"  width="500">
				<p>Taken back in 2018, this is by far my most favorite cyberpunk-themed image I've taken in addition of a few edits of the lighting and colors to emit more of a futuristic look to the picture!</p>

				<h1>Synthetic Nature</h1>
				<img src="images/pnw-synth.jpeg" alt="Pulsating Skies" class="round" width="500">
				<img src="images/nature-synth.jpeg" alt="Colorful Skies Ignite the Greenery" class="round" width="500">
				<p>Not all nature photography should look the same, sometimes nature photography intertwined with urban elements make a great combination for a chillwave aesc photo!</p>
